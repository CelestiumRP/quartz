## The Baiscs

Celestium is taking a unique approach to religion and how it is done compared to other worldbuilding server, we will respect all player made religions as canon, but they must follow these standards.

### Gods

Gods are the entities responsible for the principal elements of the universe, these be planets, stars, the wind, the water, the earth, and any other principal elements.

Gods cannot take a physical form, since their form are the elements.

Gods can be named differently for different cultures, but are still the same god.

### Spirits

Spirits are anything that isn't a god, everything has a spirit, every tree, every flower, all of the bodies of waters. They have an explicit impact on the world, much like gods, but unlike them, have a physical form, but is restricted to what they are bound too.

### Abstracts

Abstracts are spirits that are either the head of a collection of spirits(ie a forest, or the lakes in an area), or even ideas, which are a form of spirit, that are able to be received by all in the universe.

Abstracts can choose to take any form they want, but often choose not too.

### Ghosts

Ghosts are the souls of all those who died. They are often tied to an important area in their life, most choose to simply be, but others are more active.
